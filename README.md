# :computer: Laptop Store
==========================

Hello, Everybody :wave: 
There were two targets for that project, It's a simple project for a laptop store.


## First target
------------------

This project targeted the ways of aligning items that appear on the products page with css using `Flex`, `Grid`, and `Inline-block` as the first sections aligned in flex, the second sections aligned in grid, and the last one aligned in inline-block.

## Second target
------------------

Also, using `Javascript` was targeted as it is used in changing from the light mode to the dark mode using the button in the header.
